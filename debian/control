Description: dkms source for the Realtek rtw8852be driver
 rtw89 is a linux kernel module which supports the Realtek
 8852AE, 8852BE, and 8853CE 802.11ax wireless network cards. 
 .
 This package provides the rtw89 source and makes use of the
 DKMS build utility to install them for the running kernel. It is 
 intended for use with kernel versions 5.7 - 6.2, after which this 
 package should be unnecessary as the driver will be included in the
 upstream kernel source.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to build these modules.
